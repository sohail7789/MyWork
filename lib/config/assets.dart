/// rendered as a black box on device; the clips were dropped in favour of the
/// stills they used to fall back to. When replacement encodes arrive, add them
/// back here and swap the affected screens to `DesignVideo`, which is still in
/// the tree for that purpose. Keep filenames free of spaces — ExoPlayer's
/// AssetDataSource throws FileNotFoundException on any path containing one.
